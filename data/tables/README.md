- Notes
- Interchain: True if the bond is linking different protein chains
- Bad rotamer: True if the intramolecular isopeptide bond side chains are in a sub-optimal geometry (determined by visual inspection)
- Deposition date
- Assigned bond: True if the bond has been assigned (determined by the presence of a specific LINK field in the deposited PDB structure)
- Fixed: True if the bond originally was in a "Bad rotamer" state but it has been remodelled; 
- Resolution
- Unusual geometry/chemistry: True if the geometry is unusual (such as when the catalytic residue is not pointing thowards the bond residues)
